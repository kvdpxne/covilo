It is sad to say that crime does not go away very easily. However, by utilizing
the crime alert web application, we can make probable efforts to trace it as
rapidly as possible.

This web application can be similar to available social network applications.
But here, instead of posting social updates, the users can share the crimes
occurring in their area.

By informing about local crimes happening around, other people in the
neighborhood can become careful.
